# 🧾 WalletMate – Your Smart Digital Wallet

**WalletMate** is a mobile app built with React Native that lets you scan, store, and organize your **cards and receipts** — all in one place. It's designed to work kind of like Apple Wallet, but with extra features like **receipt scanning** using **AWS Textract** so you can search, track, and manage your expenses more easily.

We're building this as a side project to learn, build something useful, and hopefully turn it into something polished enough to show in internship interviews.
